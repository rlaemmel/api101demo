API-usage analysis of a 101implementation

# Features

* [Software analysis demo](http://101companies.org/index.php/101feature:Software_analysis_demo)

# Motivation

This 101contribution demonstrates API-usage analysis for the JDOM API and a specific Java-based 101implementation that uses the API. An automated analysis determines the API types and methods used; dependencies between scopes (types) of the implementation and API types are determined and visualized.

# Acknowledgement

The contribution leverages an automated analysis provided by the ShiftLab Team, University of Nebraska at Omaha, as implemented with the help of ShiftLab technology (TL, Sextant) as well as
third-party tools (mainly Cytoscape here). Thanks are due to Victor Winter specifically.
